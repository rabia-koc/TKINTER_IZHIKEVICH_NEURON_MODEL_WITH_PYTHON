## Hodgkin-Huxley model

It is a mathematical model for the generation and transmission of action potentials in neurons. The origin of this model is based on circuit theory. It describes the electrical properties of cells that respond to stimuli, such as neurons and heart muscles. It is a constantly dynamic system.

It is the electrical equivalent circuit inside an axon. Part A: equivalent circuit for a very small portion of the dice. The resistance of the intercellular fluid is neglected. Part B: It is the electrical equivalent circuit that is formed by the sequential repetition of the circuit in the A part and corresponds to the whole membrane. Membrane potential in an active electrical equivalent circuit:
